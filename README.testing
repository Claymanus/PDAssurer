You can find all the dependencies and their installation in .travis.yml
To setup (and reset) testing environment, type
make testsetup

to run all test, just type

make checkall

this currently runs the unit/integration tests, and end-to-end tests using firefox and chrome

to run just the unit/integration tests, do

make tests

for end-to-end tests run

make onlyend2endtest

if you want to use your own browser, run

make handtest

to fire up an apache on ports 8888 (plain http) and 8889 (https), and a fake smtp server on port 1025

use

make killall

to bring down the hand test environment

The test harness uses an sqlite database file at /tmp/pdoauth.db
If you can rework it to use in-memory sqlite (and initialize it!) I will be thankful.

Please look for FIXMEs for known areas with deficient testing.
And of course more input validation tests are always welcome!
